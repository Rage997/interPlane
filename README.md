# interPlane

I have been using Skyscanner (https://www.skyscanner.ch/) for a long time to plan my trips. One feature that is missing is the possibility to plan a trip and search flights through multiple cities. This feature in my opinion is really helpful because aeroplanes prices vary on a lot depending on which airports you are outbound or ingoing. An example will help me to clarify what I mean. Let's say that I want to visit in this order: Berlin-Prague-London. This may not be the most cost-efficient way to visit these cities because a flight from Berlin to London may be much more cheapie than flying from Prague to London. Visiting the cities in this order: Berlin-London-Prague may be much cheaper (just an example). This is what interPlane is for: to plan multi-cities trips in the cheapest way. 

TL;TR

interPlane computes the most cost-efficient way of visiting multiple cities by plane
